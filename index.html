  <h3>Thoughts on Web Accessability</h3>
  <p>
    To me, Web Accessability means features in a website to make it useable by everyone. That ranges from having a website with an easy to understand layout to
    having a text reader for blind people. It means that everone can see, in one way or another, what I have made.  
  </p>
  <p>
    It is important to have accessable websites because it means everyone can view your content. Why make it if people can't view it? There are also laws that require businesses to make websites accessible
    such as the European Accessability Act.
