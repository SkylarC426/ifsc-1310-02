  <h3>Thoughts on Web Accessability</h3>
  <p>
    To me, Web Accessability means features in a website to make it useable by everyone. That ranges from having a website with an easy to understand layout to
    having a text reader for blind people. It means that everone can see, in one way or another, what I have made.  
  </p>
  <p>
    It is important to have accessable websites because it means everyone can view your content. Why make it if people can't view it? There are also laws that require businesses to make websites accessible
    such as the European Accessability Act.

  <h3>Progressive Enhancement Writing Assignment</h3>
  <p>
    Progressive enhancement is designing a website to have a universal experience for everyone but to allow people with advanced browser capabilities to do more with the site. It is very similar to Graceful Degradation, with the most major change being a change in perspective. 
    Progressive enhancement is important in modern web development because it allows everyone to use websites but it gives people with more capabilities to use more features.

  <h3>Dragon Project Revision and Reflection</h3>
  <p>
    I got feedback from a friend who took this class last year. Basically, he said that my menu to go to the different web pages should be at the top, my table should be in a more orderly table format, and that my FAQ page was sparse in design and should be made prettier. He also said that I should have a background image for the page. I have taken these ideas into consideration and have implemented them in the following revised page:
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="dragon copy/index.html">Revised Dragon Webpage</a>
  </p>
  <p>
    I think that most of the suggestions he made were valid. I think having a background image may make things cluttered and messy, and I also couldn’t find something that I liked. Therefore, I decided against it. 
  </p>

  <p>
    Overall, I think that I didn’t keep pace with the class as well as I should have. I think the fact that I took it online really hampered my ability to keep the class as a priority and if I retook this class, I would do it in person.
  </p>

  <p>
    I think I did the website pretty well. It has a variety of consistent and unique layouts. It was a fun and unique challenge to undertake and I had a blast with it. I understood a lot more about web development by doing it as well.
    I think I learn better by doing things and trying stuff out by myself, so this project was a good way for me to learn.
  </p>

  <p>
    The only thing I would change about the website is how messy its CSS is. I wish it was more organized at least but it seemed like quite a hassle to try and change it. I wish I were more creative and could actually design something really interesting, but I’m pretty happy with where it is right now.
